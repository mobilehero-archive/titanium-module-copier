## 📝 Description

This module copies dependencies defined in package.json to Titanium Resources directory.

Currently, if you want to be able to use npm to install packages for Titanium, you need to do it from `/app/lib`, `/app/vendor`, or `/app/assets`.

What this module does is it gives the you (the developer) the ability to install Node.js modules for Titanium in the same place you are installing Node.js modules for everything else.
